[Icon Requests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J-kl6YXp7kNIt1NaXjKfahUIaFV-T-N2SPfaSK5m4Ns)

If you want to modify and/or redistribute cjGlyphs, get my permision first.

If you post a setup using cjGlyphs, please mention me so I can see it (and so others can find this icon pack)!

Alternate icons are included and can be enabled by using [Snowboard](https://repo.packix.com/package/com.spark.snowboard/)'s alternative icon selector. The "Alt" theme should be enabled below the "Core" theme in Snowboard's settings.

Enable both cjGlyphs and Glyphs with cjGlyphs above Glyphs.
